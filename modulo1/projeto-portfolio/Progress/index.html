                <p>
                    Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Danilo and I'm here because I have a goal in my mind. 
                    I decided to change my life! Do you think people deserve to work with something that for the most 
                    part makes you happy and fulfilled? Well... I do. I am an accounting student in the last year of 
                    the course and my professional experiences brought me more frustration than prospects for a better 
                    future. I've always believed that we should pursue our success, feel fulfilled and proud of your 
                    path in life, that's why I made the decision to come here and present to you this small portfolio. 
                    I decided to go after of my dreams and achieve my goals being an expert developer in Front End/UI/UX. 
                    I'm just at the beginning of something much bigger. Thanks to Labenu for giving me the opportunity to 
                    take my first steps towards my dream.
                </p>
